# imessage-spammer
A desktop application for sending any number of custom iMessages to another iMessage account.

### Usage
To use this application, you'll need to build with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) (or your favorite
build tool if you feel like it). Just run `bazel run :app` from the root and the application will
start.

### Future improvements
* Allow sending to iMessage accounts rather than just phone numbers
* Report error if input number is not associated with iMessage
